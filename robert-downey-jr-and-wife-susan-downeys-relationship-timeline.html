Downey portrayed Dr. Pete Graham in the horror flick, while Susan served as a producer on the film. Susan even helped her husband score one of his biggest roles to date, Sherlock Holmes, by suggesting his casting to director <strong>Guy Ritchie</strong>.</p><p>“If Susan hadn’t been in the room, Robert probably wouldn’t have become Sherlock Holmes,” Ritchie told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;in October 2014. “She facilitated it, definitely.”</p><p>In addition to welcoming their two children, Exton and Avri, the couple have teamed up on a number of projects over the years through their production company, Team Downey, including The Judge, Dolittle and Sweet Tooth. (Robert also shares son Indio with ex-wife, <strong>Deborah Falconer</strong>, whom he was married to from 1992 to 2004.)</p><p>Scroll down to relive Robert and Susan’s biggest relationship moments:</p><h3>2003</h3><p>Robert and Susan met on the set of the film Gothika, which also starred <strong>Halle Berry</strong> and <strong>Penélope Cruz</strong>. “Everybody else ordered Japanese, but Robert told us how oatmeal was the ‘superfood,’” Susan recalled of their early interactions in an October 2014 interview with The Hollywood Reporter. “He brought his own packets of oatmeal to have at lunch. And he had this box of various herbs and stuff. And then he started doing these yoga moves. I mean, he was interesting but weird.”</p><p>In October of that year, the duo made their red carpet debut at the premiere of Robert’s film The Singing Detective.

There was something magical there, something we couldn’t put our finger on. He always says that we became this third thing when we got together — something that neither of us could have become by ourselves — and I think that’s true.” (Robert has been drug-free since 2003.)</p><h3>January 2010</h3><p>Robert gave his wife a hilarious shout-out while winning Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Sherlock Holmes at the <a href=# rel=noopener>2010 Golden Globes</a>. “First of all, I’d like to thank Susan Downey for telling me that Matt Damon was going to win, so don’t bother to prepare a speech,” he joked.</p><p>He added: “I really don’t want to thank my wife because I could be bussing tables at the Daily Grill if not for her.
