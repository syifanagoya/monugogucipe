As of this writing, Manny Pacquiao's net worth is $220 million. Manny Pacquiao is an active political figure, having served as a Senator of the Philippines for many years. Among many sporting circles, Pacquiao is considered one of the best "pound for pound" boxers of all time. He is the only professional boxer to be named an eight-division world champion and has won linear championships in five different weight classes. In addition to his athletic and political careers, Pacquiao has pursued a number of business ventures to emerge as a successful entrepreneur.</p><p>The biggest and most lucrative fight of Manny's career took place in May 2015 against longtime rival Floyd Mayweather. When it was all said and done, between his guaranteed purse and pay-per-view bonus earnings, Manny ended up earning $130 million from the fight. During his career, he has earned at least $500 million from fights and endorsements.</p><p>See also: <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Net Worth</a></p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Emmanuel Dapridran Pacquiao was born on December 17th of 1978 in Kibawe, Bukidnon, a small municipal area in the Philippines. He grew up with his mother and father among six siblings until sixth grade, when his parents separated. At a young age, Pacquiao was inspired to get into combat sports by watching <a href=# title="Bruce Lee Net Worth">Bruce Lee</a> videos and Mohammed Ali fights. His family struggled with poverty, and he had to drop out of high school as a result. Pacquiao began boxing at age 14 â€“ the same year he left home in order to help his mother provide for his siblings. He has stated that he started boxing to survive, as it was something he knew that he was good at while living on the streets.</p><p>Pacquiao turned professional at age 16, although he had previously earned a spot on the national Filipino team at 14. His room and board were paid for by the government, and he had an amateur record of 60 wins and 4 losses. At 4'11 with a weight of 98 pounds, the 16-year-old Manny Pacquiao was not legally allowed to fight. He later admitted that he put weights in his socks during weigh-ins so that he could compete. He won his first professional light flyweight fight against Edmund Ignacio.</p><p>Although a loss against Rustico Torrecampo was an early setback for Pacquiao, he went on to win his next 15 fights. His first major title came when he defeated Chatchai Sasakul, and he followed this up by winning the super bantamweight title in 2001. In 2003, he fought at featherweight for the first time, dealing Antonio Barrera a TKO in the eleventh round. In order to fight <a href=# title="Erik Morales Net Worth">Erik Morales</a>, Pacquiao moved up to super featherweight in 2005. Although he lost the initial fight against his rival, he won in 2006.
