She testified throughout the hearing that his TV was on and a cigarette was still smoking.</p><p>She also spotted blood flowing to the poultry barn, according to The Irish Examiner.</p><p>She determined the chicken that attacked her father was the same one that attacked her daughter earlier after seeing blood in the claws of a bird, she added.</p><p>O’Keeffe also testified that he worked the late shift the night before and arrived home around 8 a.m. local time.</p><p>He overheard Kraus tell him to go to bed soon after feeding the animals and going to the bathroom.</p><p>O’Keeffe reported that he saw a laceration on Kraus’ calf as well as other injuries. Before paramedics arrived, he contacted 911 and was given instructions on how to perform CPR for 25 minutes.</p><p>He claimed Kraus repeatedly whispered the word “rooster” while he passed unconscious.</p><p>During the hearing, Dr. Annette Jennings shed more insight on the event, claiming that when she arrived at Kraus’ home, paramedics were attempting to resuscitate him.</p><p>He was pronounced deceased at 3:24 p.m. local time. She believed his death was strange because the injury on his left calf was inflicted by a chicken, according to The Irish Examiner.</p><p><strong>Read about:<a href=#>&nbsp;</a></strong><a href=#>Wes Gibbins Death Rumors – Is Alive And In Good Health</a></p><h2>Jasper Kraus Death</h2><p>Dr. Ramadan Shatwan performed the autopsy, claiming in court that Kraus’ face and legs were covered in blood even though he had no injuries to his face.</p><p>He died as a result of a deadly cardiac arrhythmia caused by significant coronary atheroma and cardiomegaly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/DD-COMP-chicken-1.jpg><p>According to The Irish Examiner, coroner Brian O’Connor later confirmed the victim’s cause of death, recording a verdict of misadventure. Guinan asked Dr. Shatwan if her father had a heart attack, and he responded yes, adding that his heart’s blood flow was “severely hardened,” which also contributed to his death, according to the site.</p><p>Guinan told the Examiner that her family was not startled by Kraus’ cardiac issue since they “knew his heart was awful.”</p><p>According to his obituary, Kraus died “sadly” and “suddenly,” leaving behind his son Kevin Joey, mother Oma, father Opa, and sister Ida.</p><p>Guinan’s son-in-law and grandchildren remarked that he was “deeply bereaved” and “sadly missed” by his family.</p><p><strong>Also Read:<a href=#>&nbsp;</a></strong><a href=#>Wes Gibbins Death Rumors – Is Alive And In Good Health</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yZqqqZ2iYrizrdSsZG9uXaKur3nKoqOlnZRir7p5wauYoaWRYrCptcKknKdlmaN6qr7EpZinnF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./which-is-better-orange-peel-or-knockdown-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Which is better orange peel or knockdown?</a>
